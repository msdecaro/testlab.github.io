    <p>I currently am studying at Syracuse University as an honors student in information of management and technology with a concentration in data analytics.
    <br> I grew up here in Syracuse with my parents, little sister, cat, and dog. 
    <br> My favorite color is green, and  my favorite food is popcorn.</p>
